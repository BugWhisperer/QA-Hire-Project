# Part A: Test Automation in Selenium and Behave

Behave is BDD testing framework for python. I have used selenium to implement the tests.

## Setup

Ensure you have Selenium chrome driver, python3, pip and pipenv installed. Follow the commands below to setup the virtual environment.

```
cd TestAutomation
```
```
pipenv --python 3.6
```
```
pipenv shell
```
```
pipenv install
```

### Running tests

```
behave
```
